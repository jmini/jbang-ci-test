== jbang-ci-test

Test project to run a Jbang script xref:HelloWorld.java[`HelloWorld.java`] inside a GitLab CI pipeline.

Locally the script can be executed with:

[source]
----
./jbang run HelloWorld.java
----

In GitLab CI, the build and the execute jobs are separated and allow to compile (always) or to execute (manual trigger) the script.

Chache folders (`JBANG_CACHE_DIR` and `JBANG_REPO`) are explicitly set up in order to be cached by GitLab.

The variable `JBANG_OPTS` can be modified in order to add options.
Setting the value to `--verbose` allows to get more output from Jbang.
